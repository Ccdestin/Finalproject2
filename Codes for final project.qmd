## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(esquisse)
library(gtsummary)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```

# Introduction to data

The blood_storage files contains survey data on patients that are diabetic. It contains information about their ages, recurrence frequency, and blood sugar levels. People with diabetes using insulin therapy should regularly monitor their blood glucose levels. This is especially important to people using basal insulin, who should have a meter and glucose strips available in case of hypoglycemia

In this Quarto report, I conducted an analysis with the objective of exploring the different variables associated with blood_storage.

```{r read-in-data, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
blood_storage <- load(here::here("data/blood_storage.rda"))
```

```{r clean-data, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
completedata<-na.omit(blood_storage)
```

```{r}
Age<- c (72.1,73.6,67.5,65.8,63.2,65.4,67.1)
std_dev <- sd(Age)
print(std_dev)
```

```{r}
Lable <- 
tbl_summary(
	blood_storage,
	by = Age,
	include = c(FamHx, TVol, PVol,
							T.Stage, bGS, PreopPSA))

print(Lable)
```

```{r}

tbl_uvregression(
	blood_storage,
	y = AA,
	include = c(Units, PVol,
							T.Stage, bGS, PreopPSA),
	method = glm,
	method.args = list(family = binomial()),
	exponentiate = TRUE)
	
```

```{r}
Lable: tbl-one
tbl-cap: "This the age of participants"
knitr::kable(blood_storage)

```

```{r}
hist(blood_storage$Age,main=" Age of participants")
```

```{r}
gtsummary::inline_text()

```
